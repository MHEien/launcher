# Business Model: Open Core Strategy

## Overview
The launcher follows an **Open Core** model—a fully functional open-source "Community Edition" with proprietary premium features for monetization.

## Open Source (Community Edition)
Everything in this repository is open source under a permissive license:

- **Core Launcher:** Window management, hotkey activation, search UI
- **Search & Indexing:** File, app, and command indexing
- **Inline Tools:** Calculator, unit conversions, quick actions
- **Plugin System:** Full plugin API, sandboxing, lifecycle management
- **Theme Engine:** OS theme detection, CSS variable injection, custom themes
- **Theme Marketplace:** Community themes (free)
- **Plugin Marketplace Client:** Browse, install, update plugins

## Proprietary (Premium/Paid)
Closed-source services requiring subscription or one-time purchase:

### AI Features (Subscription)
- Agentic AI chat with tool use
- AI-powered search and context understanding
- Natural language commands
- Multi-step workflow automation
- AI integration with plugins

### Premium Plugins & Tools
- Advanced integrations (enterprise SaaS)
- Premium productivity tools
- Priority support

### Marketplace Backend
- Plugin hosting and distribution infrastructure
- Developer accounts and publishing tools
- Payment processing for paid plugins

## Revenue Streams
1. **AI Subscription:** Monthly/yearly plans for AI features
2. **Paid Plugins:** Revenue share with plugin developers (e.g., 70/30)
3. **Premium Themes:** Optional paid themes from designers
4. **Enterprise Licensing:** Custom deployments, support contracts

## Philosophy
- Community Edition must be **genuinely useful** standalone—not crippled
- Premium features add power, not unlock basics
- Open source builds trust and community contributions
- Proprietary AI covers API costs and funds development
